I'm living in Sheffield with my wife. I like it here.

I'm "the IT guy" at a small biotech company, [Tissue & Cell Technologies](https://www.t-ct.com/) - a human tissue bank that stores adipose tissue for breast reconstruction in cancer patients. Mostly a 50/50 split of sysadmin and full-stack software development. Thursdays are spent fixing the printer. 

Jack of all trades, master of some.
