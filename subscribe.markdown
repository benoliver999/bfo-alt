You don't have to keep coming back to this website if you want post updates.

## RSS

RSS is old but good. [This is the link to the feed.](/feed.xml)

You can use something like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to take the RSS feed and have it email you when a new post comes out. It's dead easy, honest.

## Fediverse (mastodon)

The site's RSS goes out to my mastodon account [here](https://social.bfoliver.com/@ben). This might also include quick posts from me.

## Twitter

Posts automatically go out to twitter. I don't really post anything else there, so it's a good way to get notified when posts go up.

I am [@benoliver999](https://twitter.com/benoliver999) on there.
